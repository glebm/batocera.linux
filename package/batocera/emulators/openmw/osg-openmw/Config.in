	  The OpenSceneGraph is a graphics toolkit for the development of
	  graphic applications such as flight simulators, games, virtual
	  reality and scientific visualization. Based around the concept of a
	  scene graph, it provides an object-oriented framework on top of
	  OpenGL, freeing the developer from implementing and optimizing low
	  level graphics calls, and provides many additional utilities for
	  development of graphics applications.
